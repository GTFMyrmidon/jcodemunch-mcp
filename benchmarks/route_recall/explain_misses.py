"""Turn route_recall misses into a named-gate defect list.

``run_route_recall.py`` measures THAT route missed. This says WHY, using the
same ``counter`` functions the live front door uses, so the two artifacts cannot
drift into disagreeing about the same run.

The distinction that makes it worth running: a recall number treats every miss
as one kind of failure, and they are not. A miss where the action was never
scored (a curated rule fired for something else and rules short-circuit the
lexical fallback) looks identical in the recall figure to a miss where it scored
and lost by a point. Tuning weights fixes the second and cannot touch the first.

Run:
    PYTHONPATH=src python benchmarks/route_recall/explain_misses.py
    PYTHONPATH=src python benchmarks/route_recall/explain_misses.py --write
