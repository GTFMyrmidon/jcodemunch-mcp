"""v1.108.269 — a withheld oversize file says so, and the cap is reachable.

jcodemunch-mcp #429, filed against 1.108.264 after `src/jcodemunch_mcp/
server.py` crossed `DEFAULT_MAX_FILE_SIZE` by 532 bytes and the MCP entrypoint
stopped entering its own index.

The size cap itself is working as designed — v1.108.193 made `too_large` a
WITHHELD reason precisely so a corpus missing a real, current, wanted file
refuses to certify absence. Two things around it were not.

**1. The exclusion was silent on the path that matters.** `resolve_explicit_
paths` warned per entry; the `os.walk` path bumped a counter and said nothing.
Same limit, same repo, and whether you were told depended on whether you had
passed `paths=`. The counter surfaced only inside a verdict block, and only
when some later query happened to ask about absence and got refused — so a user
with a 600KB generated client got quietly incomplete answers with no signal
that anything had been withheld. `index_repo` did not even count it.

**2. The per-call override was unreachable over MCP.** `get_max_file_size` has
accepted `max_size` since .193, but no caller passed one and it reached no tool
schema, so over the transport every actual user is on, editing a config file
was the only route.

⚠ And `index_repo.discover_source_files` carried a hardcoded `500 * 1024`
default that consulted neither config nor env — a FOURTH copy of the limit, so
.193's escape hatch and .197's per-project key both applied to `index_folder`
and did nothing at all for a GitHub repo. A cap fixed on one discovery path is
not fixed.
