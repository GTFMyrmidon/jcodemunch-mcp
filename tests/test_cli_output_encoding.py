"""CLI output is UTF-8 even when piped (v1.108.262).

On Windows `sys.stdout` is the CONSOLE stream (already UTF-8) when attached to a
terminal and the LOCALE stream (cp1252) when piped or redirected. So a command
printing any character cp1252 cannot encode worked interactively and died the
moment anything consumed it:

    jcodemunch-mcp receipt --explain            # fine
    jcodemunch-mcp receipt --explain | more     # UnicodeEncodeError, no output

`receipt --explain` writes U+2212 MINUS SIGN; `render_diagram` writes U+2713
CHECK MARK. A hard traceback out of a shipped command, in the one configuration
nobody exercises by hand and every script uses.

⚠ Sibling of the cp1252 DECODE class swept in v1.108.230. That sweep hardened
subprocess INPUT and left our own OUTPUT alone, which is the shape a fix leaves
when it is scoped to the symptom that was reported rather than to the hazard.
See tests/test_subprocess_encoding_guard.py for the other half.

⚠ These tests run the CLI in a SUBPROCESS with a pipe, because that is the only
configuration that reproduces it. Calling the formatter in-process cannot fail:
pytest's capture layer accepts any string.
