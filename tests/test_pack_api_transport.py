"""The starter-pack API transport, and the three ways it misreported failure.

From #417 and #418 (@MotoMato85), whose measurements are in the issues. These
are transport-and-reporting concerns rather than catalog rendering, which is why
they live beside `test_install_pack.py` instead of inside it.

⚠⚠ Neither underlying defect is in this repo, and that shapes every assertion
here. The 403 is a CDN rule in front of jcodemunch.com; the ignored
`X-JCM-License` header is `index.php`. What this file pins is the only half we
own — the SHAPE of the request we send, and the WORDS we print when it fails.

⚠ Nothing here talks to the network, deliberately. Asserting the CDN's live
behaviour would make our suite fail on someone else's config change, and would
go green the moment the real fix landed — which is exactly when we would still
want to know our request had not silently reverted to the default header set.
