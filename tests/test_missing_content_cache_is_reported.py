"""A body the index cannot produce must be reported, never returned as `""`.

Resolving a symbol and producing its source are two different successes. The row
lives in the `.db`; the bytes live in a separate content directory. When that
directory is absent -- pruned, copied without its sibling, or never shipped, as
with a starter pack, which carries `.db` files only -- `get_symbol_source`
returned the row with `source: ""` under `_meta.verdict.state == "ok"` and
`_freshness: "fresh"`. Measured against the published `nodejs` pack on
2026-07-30: bodies for 0 of 50 symbols, every one of them reported confidently.

These tests build that exact store shape: a real index with no content
directory beside it.
