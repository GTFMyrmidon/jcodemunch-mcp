"""#415: get_blast_radius must not report a citable 0 for a symbol its import
graph cannot reach.

Go addresses imports at package granularity (``import "mod/pkg"`` names a
directory of files, and files inside that package need no import at all), so the
file-level importer graph lands on no member file and every symbol in the package
comes back with zero importers. The defect was that this was indistinguishable
from a symbol nothing depends on: ``overall_risk_score: 0.0`` with no verdict.

The controls matter as much as the assertions. A Python symbol reached through a
resolvable ``from ... import ...`` must keep a real risk score and an ``ok``
verdict, or this would be a fix that simply refuses every answer.
