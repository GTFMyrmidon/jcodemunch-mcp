"""v1.108.193 — the size cap can be raised, and a withheld file blocks absence.

Both reported by @dkiaulakis (jcodemunch-mcp #375 thread, by mail 2026-07-27),
measured on 1.108.188.

The ask was small: give `MAX_FILE_SIZE` the env override its two neighbours in
`security.py` already have. The finding underneath it is not small. A file
refused for size is counted as an ordinary structural exclusion, so the coverage
contract shipped in 1.108.176 calls the index complete — correctly by its own
definition — while the exact file an agent asked about is missing. In his words:

    Size is the one exclusion reason where the file is real, current, and wanted.

That is the same disease the 1.108.171-.176 releases were about, arriving
through a different door: "I never learned that file" rendering as "that file
does not exist."
