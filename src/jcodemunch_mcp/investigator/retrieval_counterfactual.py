"""Why was this action not proposed? A deterministic route counterfactual.

The 2026-08-02 deep-research report named this as the strongest genuinely-new
idea in its portfolio, and the reason is measurable rather than aesthetic:
``benchmarks/route_recall/results.json`` records that ``route`` misses
elementary intents -- "show me the body of this function", "I need this function
plus everything it imports", "is this name used anywhere at all or can I drop
it" -- and an evaluator can see THAT they missed while having no production-grade
account of WHY. A recall number you cannot decompose is a number you cannot fix.

This module converts a miss into a named gate.

## What it is not

Not a debug log, and not a second scorer. Every gate here is evaluated with the
same ``counter`` functions the live front door uses -- ``_query_tokens``,
``_idf_weights``, ``score_action``, ``_INTENT_RULES`` -- so an explanation that
disagrees with production is a bug in this file, not a difference of opinion. A
test asserts the reconstruction matches ``classify_intent`` + ``search_catalog``
on every benchmark query.

⚠ **Not registered as an MCP tool**, and deliberately. The report's own
recommendation in the same document is a moratorium on new top-level actions
until route recall improves; adding a 92nd action to explain why the 91st is
hard to reach would be self-refuting. It is importable, tested, and driven by
the benchmark harness -- which is the workflow the report says it has to feed to
matter at all.

## The gate order is the pipeline order

``_handle_route`` does exactly this, and the order is load-bearing because the
FIRST gate that excludes a candidate is the only one worth reporting -- the
others are downstream of a decision already made:

  1. the action is not in the live catalog at all       -> ``catalog_absent``
  2. the query reduces to nothing scorable              -> ``empty_query``
  3. a curated rule proposed it                         -> returned
  4. a curated rule proposed something ELSE, and rules
     short-circuit the lexical fallback entirely        -> ``rule_preempted``
  5. no query token appears in its name or description  -> ``no_lexical_overlap``
  6. it scored, but below the cutoff                    -> ``ranked_below_cutoff``
  7. otherwise                                          -> returned

⚠⚠ **Gate 4 is the one that did not exist before this module.** ``route`` runs
the fallback ONLY when ``classify_intent`` returns nothing. So a query that
trips any rule never scores the rest of the catalog, and an action that would
have ranked first lexically is not "ranked below cutoff" -- it was never
scored. Reading that miss as a ranking problem sends you to tune weights that
were never consulted.
