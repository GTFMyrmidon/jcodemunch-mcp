"""Per-symbol freshness classification (v1.77.0).

Four buckets:
  * ``fresh``               — index SHA matches HEAD AND the file mtime is
                              not newer than the index timestamp.
  * ``edited_uncommitted``  — index SHA matches HEAD but the on-disk file
                              has been edited since indexing (mtime newer
                              than indexed_at).
  * ``stale_index``         — the whole index lags behind: index SHA does
                              not match the current git HEAD.
  * ``unknown``             — the comparison could not be made at all: no
                              source root, the root moved, the file is gone
                              from the tree, the stat failed, or the index
                              recorded no timestamp to compare against.

``unknown`` exists for the same reason ``repo_freshness`` grew it in
v1.108.180 (#377 item 4), one level down: this classifier used to answer
``fresh`` whenever it could not measure, so a served symbol whose freshness
was never established claimed to be current. "I could not find out" is a
third fact, not a clean bill of health — and it is the answer for exactly
the population that cannot self-diagnose: a ``.db``-only starter pack, an
index built on another machine, a source root that has since moved.

The probe caches per-call git HEAD lookup and per-file mtime stats so
classifying many symbols in one tool call is cheap.
