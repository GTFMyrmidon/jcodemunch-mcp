"""Producer registration and canonical projectors (#377 Phase 2, P2).

An envelope without registration is a contract anything can mint into, which is
the defect this phase exists to fix. A tool must not be able to mint evidence by
returning a dict that happens to look right. A reviewed producer registers, once:

    verdict shape + scorer pin      proof kinds it may mint
    canonical projector            completeness semantics
    freshness semantics            coverage semantics
    integrity rules                snapshot fields

**This is where the hardest lesson from the 1.x hardening work goes.**
``get_ranked_context`` asserted "Do not claim this feature exists" from an early
return that never called ``build_verdict``, so eight shipped absence gates were
invisible to it until v1.108.179 went looking. An early return is a second
implementation of the answer and inherits nothing. Registration makes that
structural rather than remembered:

    minting requires a verdict of the shape this producer registered.

An exit that asserts absence without building a verdict therefore cannot mint —
not because it is listed as an exception, but because it never produced the
thing a receipt is derived from.

**The gate has now fired twice on its own author, which is the record worth
keeping.** In v1.108.183 three exits could not mint because they emitted no
verdict: ``search_symbols``' semantic and fusion paths, and
``get_ranked_context``'s fusion path. v1.108.184 gave the semantic one a verdict
and v1.108.185 gave both fusion ones a verdict — and each time that made the exit
mintable under a ``completeness`` declaration written for a different operation
("lexical BM25 over the inverted index", false for an embedding ranking and
imprecise for a four-channel fusion). Each time the pinning test failed, the mode
got reviewed, and it now declares its own completeness through
``completeness_by_mode``. A capability that reads enforced and is not is the
failure this whole phase exists to prevent, so the gate catching its own author is
the design working, not a nuisance.

The two reviews reached OPPOSITE conclusions, which is the point of reviewing
modes rather than porting a rule: a semantic zero result cannot prove absence
(it rests on embedding geometry), while a fusion zero result can (its lexical and
identity channels are complete passes, so an empty fused set is a corpus fact).

The canonical projector is also the structural fix for the class of bug the
hand-kept ``handoff._SCOPE_ARGS`` tuple keeps having (review item 12): a new
result-changing argument is added and nobody remembers to list it. Here each
producer declares its own narrowing and mode keys beside the exit that reads
them, and the projector emits a descriptor of the operation that actually ran
rather than leaving the finalizer to reverse-engineer semantics from caller
arguments.

Phase 2 does not BUILD the snapshot. Every field in it already ships:
``retrieval/subject_state.capture`` (generation, .db mtime, live HEAD),
``FreshnessProbe.repo_freshness`` (v1.108.180), ``verdict.index_coverage_meta``
(v1.108.176) and ``verdict.working_tree`` (v1.108.181). This module binds them
and derives the evidence id from them, so different snapshots cannot share an id.
